## Assignment 1 (algo_ass1)

### Overview
The code in this repository addresses Assignment 2 and focuses on the implementation of algorithms to solve specific problems. The primary function, `q1_c`, is designed to determine the survival strategy for a given scenario involving height, attempts, and maximum survival height.

## Question 1 (q1_c)
The function `q1_c` takes three parameters - `h` (height), `attempts` (number of attempts), and `msh` (max survival height). It utilizes a combination of binary search, iterative search, and linear search to determine the survival strategy for the given scenario. The results are stored in an ArrayList.

### Usage
Explore each function in the `ass_1` class by running the `main` method with appropriate inputs. Refer to the specific README file in the `algo_ass1` directory for detailed information.

## Assignment 2 (algo_ass2)

### Overview
The code in this repository focuses on the construction of a binary tree based on a specific algorithm. The implementation includes a `Node` class for representing tree nodes and a `QuestionNum2` class to create and manipulate the binary tree.

## Node Class
The `Node` class defines the structure of a binary tree node with data, left, and right child references.

## QuestionNum2 Class
The `QuestionNum2` class contains the main logic for creating a binary tree. It utilizes a list of binary representations to construct a binary tree according to specific criteria.

### Usage
To see the results for a specific scenario, modify the parameters in the `main` method inside the `algo_ass2` class. Run the program to observe the survival strategy output.
